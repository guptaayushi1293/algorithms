# Data Structures And Algorithms

Algorithms are categorised into multiple topics. Each algorithm is marked 
with difficulty level and data structure it uses.

# Recursion
1. Tower of Hanoi (Medium, Stack)
2. Sorted Array (Easy, Stack)
3. Binary String of length n (Easy, Stack)
4. K-ary String of length n (Medium, Stack)
